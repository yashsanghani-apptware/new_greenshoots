Based on the complete logging output you've provided, the policy evaluator appears to be functioning correctly. Hereâ€™s an analysis of the scenarios and their outcomes:

### Scenario 1: Manager with special clearance and high level accessing a secure resource at HQ
- **Policies Evaluated**: "Admin or Manager with High Clearance"
- **Conditions**:
  - **Condition 1**: Checks if the user is an Admin or a Manager with special clearance and a clearance level greater than 7.
    - **Result**: `true` (User is a Manager with special clearance and a clearance level of 8).
  - **Condition 2**: Checks if the user is active and not suspended.
    - **Result**: `true` (User is active and not suspended).
- **Final Result**: `ALLOW`

### Scenario 2: Junior researcher from R&D accessing a flagged resource during maintenance
- **Policies Evaluated**: "Admin or Manager with High Clearance"
- **Conditions**:
  - **Condition 1**: Checks if the user is an Admin or a Manager with special clearance and a clearance level greater than 7.
    - **Result**: `false` (User is a Researcher, not an Admin or Manager).
  - **Condition 2**: Checks if the user is active and not suspended.
    - **Result**: `true` (User is active and not suspended).
- **Final Result**: `DENY` (Because all conditions need to be true for `ALLOW` and one was false)

### Scenario 3: Senior staff accessing a sensitive project resource with appropriate tenure
- **Policies Evaluated**: "Admin or Manager with High Clearance"
- **Conditions**:
  - **Condition 1**: Checks if the user is an Admin or a Manager with special clearance and a clearance level greater than 7.
    - **Result**: `false` (User is a Director, not an Admin or Manager).
  - **Condition 2**: Checks if the user is active and not suspended.
    - **Result**: `true` (User is active and not suspended).
- **Final Result**: `DENY` (Again, all conditions need to be true for `ALLOW` and one was false)

### Scenario 4: Inactive admin trying to access a flagged resource during maintenance
- **Policies Evaluated**: "Admin or Manager with High Clearance"
- **Conditions**:
  - **Condition 1**: Checks if the user is an Admin or a Manager with special clearance and a clearance level greater than 7.
    - **Result**: `true` (User is an Admin).
  - **Condition 2**: Checks if the user is active and not suspended.
    - **Result**: `false` (User is inactive).
- **Final Result**: `DENY` (One condition is false, leading to denial)

### Conclusion:

1. **Correct Condition Evaluation**: The conditions for each scenario are being evaluated correctly, using the compound expressions and custom operators as intended.

2. **Logical Flow**: The evaluator correctly identifies when conditions are met or not met and applies the correct logic (e.g., `AND` conditions require all to be true).

3. **Final Decision**: The system correctly grants or denies access based on the evaluation of all conditions in each scenario.

### Summary:
Given the detailed logging and the results that align with the expected logic, we can conclude that the policy evaluator is functioning correctly and is robust enough to handle complex compound conditions and custom operators. The evaluator is making correct access decisions based on the defined policies, user attributes, resource attributes, and context.
