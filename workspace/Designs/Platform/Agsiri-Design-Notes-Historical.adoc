   At this stage, this farm is eligible for trading and it will go through the trading flow.
This is for investors to buy and sell shares of the investment
Shares can be sold by the investor at any time after the initial holding period.
Shares to be sold are subject to the minimum shares that can be held by the investor, the only exception is if they want to sell all the shares
The investor initiates the process by specifying how many shares they want sell. To make things simple, they cannot specify the ask price nor can they provide a limit. The share price will always be determined by the system
Once the 'Sale Process' is initiated, the system generates a campaign to be sent out to all the customers with the complete details of the sale
If one or more customers are interested in buying part or all the shares (subject to the limitation above), then the sale can proceed
If there is oversubscription on the shares, it will be treated on a first come first serve basis.
If there is under subscription on the shares, the seller can only sell the number of shares the buyer(s) are interested in
If there is no interest from any of the customers, the seller will not be able to sell any of the shares
The seller will be paying a transaction fee (say 1% of the transaction cost)
The buyer will also pay a transaction fee (say 1% of the transaction cost)
