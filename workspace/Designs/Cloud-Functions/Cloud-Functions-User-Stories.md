# User Stories and Scenarios for CloudFunctions Service

## User Story 1: Extensible Function Deployment
As a system administrator,
I want to deploy functions that can extend system behavior without modifying the base code,
So that I can enhance and customize system capabilities dynamically as business needs evolve.

Scenario 1.1: Deploying a New Analytical Function
Given I am a system administrator responsible for adding new capabilities,
When I upload a ZIP file containing a Python script data_analysis.py that performs advanced data analytics,

Then the CloudFunctions service should validate, extract, store the function, and provide me with a unique function ID 12345.

Example:
POST /api/functions/deploy/
Body: { "file": "data_analysis.zip" }
Response: { "message": "Function deployed successfully", "function_id": "12345" }

## User Story 2: Serverless Function Execution
As a developer,
I want to execute functions without the need to manage server infrastructure,
So that I can run custom actions or computations efficiently and cost-effectively.

Scenario 2.1: Executing a Deployed Function for Data Transformation
Given I am a developer working on a project that requires on-the-fly data transformation,
When I send data to the transform_data function with ID 67890,
Then the function should process the data without me worrying about server configurations or maintenance.

Example:
POST /api/functions/67890/run/
Body: { "data": { "values": [1, 2, 3, 4] } }
Response: { "result": [2, 4, 6, 8] }

## User Story 3: Data Pipeline Creation for Analysis
As a business analyst or data scientist,
I want to create and monitor data processing pipelines using cloud functions,
So that I can perform a variety of data science activities such as data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.

Scenario 3.1: Creating a Data Pipeline for Customer Data Segmentation
Given I am a data scientist needing to perform customer segmentation,
When I sequentially execute clean_data, transform_data, and segment_data functions with respective IDs 11111, 22222, and 33333,
Then each function should receive the output of its predecessor as input, and the final function should output segmented customer data.

Example:
POST /api/functions/11111/run/ followed by /api/functions/22222/run/ and /api/functions/33333/run/
Body for Each: { "data": { "previous_output": {} } } (dynamically filled)
Final Response: { "segments": { "premium": 200, "basic": 1500 } }

## User Story 4: Chaining Functions for Data Flow
As a developer,
I want to chain multiple functions together where the output of one function can serve as the input to another,
So that I can create complex data processing workflows efficiently.

Scenario 4.1: Automated Data Processing Chain for Real-time Analytics
Given I have set up a chain of three functions extract_data, normalize_data, and load_data for a real-time data pipeline,
When extract_data is triggered by an external event and processes new data,
Then the output should automatically pass through normalize_data and finally to load_data without manual intervention.

Example:
POST /api/functions/extract_data/run/ (Triggered externally)
Chain Execution: Automatically passes output to /api/functions/normalize_data/run/ then /api/functions/load_data/run/
Final Response: { "status": "Data loaded successfully", "records": 500 }

## User Story 5: Monitoring Function Performance
As an analyst,
I want to monitor function performance and runtime metrics,
So that I can detect and analyze any anomalous behavior of these functions to ensure optimal operation and troubleshooting.

### Acceptance Criteria
Metric Collection: The system should automatically collect detailed metrics on each function execution, including start time, end time, duration, memory usage, CPU usage, and error rates.

### Accessibility: Metrics should be easily accessible through a dashboard or API for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.
Alerts and Notifications: The system should support configuring alerts based on specific metric thresholds or anomalies, sending notifications to relevant stakeholders.

### Anomaly Detection: Implement machine learning algorithms or statistical methods to detect anomalous patterns in function execution that deviate from normal behavior.

## Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Real-time Metrics Monitoring
Given that a function is actively being used in production,
When the function executes,
Then the system should capture and display real-time metrics in a monitoring dashboard accessible to the analyst.
Example:

Action: An analyst logs into the monitoring dashboard.
Check: The dashboard updates in real-time displaying execution metrics for each function.

### Scenario 2: Setting Alerts for Slow Execution
Given the ability to set performance thresholds,
When a function's execution time exceeds a predefined threshold,
Then the system should trigger an alert and notify the analyst via email or a messaging platform.
Example:

Configuration: An analyst sets an alert for any function that runs longer than 120 seconds.
Trigger: A function execution takes 150 seconds.
Outcome: The system sends an email to the analyst detailing the slow execution.

### Scenario 3: Analyzing Historical Performance Data
Given a store of historical execution metrics,
When an analyst queries the performance of a function over the past month,
Then the system should provide detailed metrics and trends that can be used for deeper analysis.
Example:

Action: An analyst requests a report on the monthly performance of a specific function.
Response: The system generates a report showing daily averages and variances in execution time, resource usage, and error rates.

### Scenario 4: Anomaly Detection in Function Execution
Given a machine learning model trained to recognize normal function behavior,
When a function execution deviates significantly from the modelâ€™s expectations,
Then the system should log an anomaly event and notify the analyst.
Example:

Normal Behavior: A function typically executes in 50-60 seconds with minimal errors.
Anomaly: A function execution takes 200 seconds with multiple errors.
Notification: The system detects the anomaly, logs the event, and sends a detailed alert to the analyst.

## Implementation Considerations
- Data Collection: Integrate with cloud providers' native monitoring tools or use custom instrumentation in the function code.
- Storage: Use a time-series database for efficient storage and querying of metric data.
- Machine Learning: Use existing libraries and frameworks for anomaly detection, training models directly on metric data.
- Dashboard: Develop or integrate with an existing dashboard solution that supports real-time data updates and interactive analysis.

These detailed user stories and scenarios provide a clear view of how different users interact with the CloudFunctions service, highlighting the flexibility, scalability, and efficiency of serverless computing environments.
