### Analysis and Recommendations for Delete Operations

In the current design, metadata related to DataRooms, Cabinets, and Files are stored in MongoDB, while the actual files and their version trees are stored in Amazon S3. Given the need to comply with various regulatory requirements and privacy controls, delete operations must be carefully designed to ensure compliance, data security, and traceability. Below, I will provide a detailed analysis of delete operations at each level (DataRoom, Cabinet, and File) and explore different scenarios to guide the implementation of a compliant deletion process.

### 1. **Delete Operations at the DataRoom Level**

#### **Scenarios**
- **Scenario 1: Full Deletion of a DataRoom**
  - The entire DataRoom, including all Cabinets and Files, is deleted.
- **Scenario 2: Logical Deletion (Soft Delete)**
  - The DataRoom is marked as deleted, but the actual data remains for compliance and audit purposes.
- **Scenario 3: Regulatory Hold**
  - The DataRoom cannot be deleted due to regulatory requirements, such as ongoing legal cases or investigations.

#### **Recommendations**
- **Full Deletion (Scenario 1)**:
  - **Metadata in MongoDB**: 
    - Remove the DataRoom document and all related Cabinets and Files documents from MongoDB.
    - Ensure all `audit_trail` records are retained and linked to a higher-level audit or archive collection.
  - **Files in S3**: 
    - Use a **multi-step deletion process**:
      - Step 1: Mark files and versions in S3 as "pending deletion" and move them to a "quarantine" bucket.
      - Step 2: After a predefined retention period (e.g., 30 days), permanently delete the files from S3.
      - **Reason**: This approach ensures compliance with regulations requiring a grace period before complete deletion.
  
- **Logical Deletion (Scenario 2)**:
  - **Metadata in MongoDB**:
    - Add a `deleted_at` field and set it to the current date, marking the DataRoom as logically deleted.
    - Retain all metadata and link to audit logs for traceability.
  - **Files in S3**:
    - Move files to a "deleted" bucket in S3, where they are retained for a specific period before final deletion.
    - Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized access to logically deleted files.
    - **Reason**: This method allows recovery if the deletion was accidental and ensures compliance with retention policies.

- **Regulatory Hold (Scenario 3)**:
  - **Metadata in MongoDB**:
    - Add a `hold_status` field to indicate that the DataRoom is under regulatory hold.
    - Prevent deletion operations while the hold is active.
  - **Files in S3**:
    - Prevent deletion of files in S3 by modifying bucket policies or applying a legal hold.
    - Regularly audit and review the hold status to ensure compliance.
    - **Reason**: Legal holds ensure that data is preserved during legal investigations or audits.

### 2. **Delete Operations at the Cabinet Level**

#### **Scenarios**
- **Scenario 1: Deletion of a Single Cabinet**
  - A Cabinet and all its associated Files are deleted.
- **Scenario 2: Deletion of Nested Cabinets**
  - Deleting a parent Cabinet also deletes its nested Cabinets and all associated Files.
- **Scenario 3: Retention of Specific Cabinets**
  - Certain Cabinets are retained due to compliance requirements, even if other Cabinets in the DataRoom are deleted.

#### **Recommendations**
- **Single Cabinet Deletion (Scenario 1)**:
  - **Metadata in MongoDB**:
    - Delete the Cabinet document and all associated File documents from MongoDB.
    - Update the DataRoom document to remove references to the deleted Cabinet.
    - Maintain an audit trail of the deletion process.
  - **Files in S3**:
    - Similar to DataRoom deletion, move files to a "quarantine" bucket for a retention period before permanent deletion.
    - Implement access restrictions during the quarantine period.
  
- **Nested Cabinets Deletion (Scenario 2)**:
  - **Metadata in MongoDB**:
    - Recursively delete the parent Cabinet and all nested Cabinets.
    - Ensure all File documents linked to these Cabinets are also deleted.
    - Keep detailed audit logs of the cascading deletion process.
  - **Files in S3**:
    - Apply the same multi-step deletion process for all files associated with the nested Cabinets.
    - **Reason**: Ensures that data associated with nested structures is fully and securely deleted.
  
- **Retention of Specific Cabinets (Scenario 3)**:
  - **Metadata in MongoDB**:
    - Mark Cabinets with a `retention_policy` field, indicating they cannot be deleted until certain conditions are met.
    - Allow selective deletion of non-protected Cabinets.
  - **Files in S3**:
    - Use S3 Object Lock to prevent deletion of files associated with Cabinets under retention.
    - Regularly review retention policies to ensure compliance and remove locks when no longer needed.

### 3. **Delete Operations at the File Level**

#### **Scenarios**
- **Scenario 1: Deletion of a Single File**
  - A specific file, along with all its versions, is deleted.
- **Scenario 2: Deletion of Specific File Versions**
  - Only certain versions of a file are deleted, while others are retained.
- **Scenario 3: Retention of Files for Compliance**
  - Files are retained due to compliance requirements, even if other files in the Cabinet are deleted.

#### **Recommendations**
- **Single File Deletion (Scenario 1)**:
  - **Metadata in MongoDB**:
    - Delete the File document from MongoDB.
    - Remove references to the File in the associated Cabinet document.
    - Retain audit logs detailing the deletion operation.
  - **Files in S3**:
    - Apply a **soft delete**: Move the file to a "quarantine" bucket for a retention period before final deletion.
    - Mark the file in S3 with metadata indicating it is pending deletion.
    - **Reason**: Ensures compliance with data retention policies while allowing time for recovery if needed.
  
- **Deletion of Specific File Versions (Scenario 2)**:
  - **Metadata in MongoDB**:
    - Remove the specific version entry from the `versions` array in the File document.
    - Update the `version` field to reflect the most recent version.
    - Maintain an audit log of the version deletion.
  - **Files in S3**:
    - Permanently delete the specific version from S3 or move it to a "version history" bucket for archiving.
    - **Reason**: Allows fine-grained control over which versions are retained or deleted, supporting compliance and space management.
  
- **Retention of Files for Compliance (Scenario 3)**:
  - **Metadata in MongoDB**:
    - Mark the File with a `retention_policy` field, indicating it cannot be deleted.
    - Prevent deletion operations on these files through application-level controls.
  - **Files in S3**:
    - Apply S3 Object Lock to ensure the file is immutable for the duration of the retention policy.
    - Regularly audit these files to ensure compliance with the retention policy.
    - **Reason**: Ensures that files required for compliance are securely retained and protected from accidental deletion.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Audit Logs**:
  - Ensure that all delete operations (soft or hard) are logged in the `audit_trail` to maintain a complete history of actions taken.
  - Use MongoDBâ€™s TTL (Time to Live) indexes for managing the retention of audit logs themselves.

- **Legal and Compliance Reviews**:
  - Regularly review deletion processes with legal and compliance teams to ensure they meet the latest regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific regulations.
  - Implement workflows for handling deletion requests, especially when they involve sensitive or protected data.

- **Data Recovery**:
  - Develop and maintain a robust data recovery process, particularly for logically deleted (soft deleted) data. This ensures that accidental deletions can be reversed within a specific period.

### **Conclusion**

Delete operations in a system that handles sensitive documents and must comply with regulatory and privacy controls are complex and require a well-thought-out strategy. By implementing a combination of soft deletes, retention policies, audit trails, and legal holds, you can ensure that your deletion process is both compliant and secure. Additionally, ensuring that all delete operations are traceable and reversible (within a certain period) will help maintain data integrity and compliance with regulatory requirements.
