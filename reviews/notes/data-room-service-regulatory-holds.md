### Handling Regulatory Holds and Workflow Triggers

To effectively manage regulatory holds and control Data Room assets via workflows, we need to extend our data models to include fields and structures that capture this information. Below are my thoughts and recommendations on how to handle these aspects in the system.

### 1. **Regulatory Hold Management**

#### **Purpose**
Regulatory holds are essential for ensuring that certain data cannot be altered or deleted during legal proceedings, audits, or investigations. A regulatory hold ensures that data remains intact and accessible until the hold is lifted.

#### **Implementation in Data Models**
We should add a `regulatory_hold` field to the DataRoom, Cabinet, and File models to track whether an item is under a hold. This field should include details such as the reason for the hold, the entity that imposed the hold, and the date it was applied.

#### **DataRoom Model Update**
```typescript
export interface IDataRoom extends Document {
  // ... existing fields
  regulatory_hold?: {
    hold_id: mongoose.Types.ObjectId; // Unique identifier for the hold
    reason: string; // Reason for the hold (e.g., legal investigation, audit)
    applied_by: mongoose.Types.ObjectId; // User or entity who applied the hold
    applied_at: Date; // Date when the hold was applied
    status: 'ACTIVE' | 'RELEASED'; // Status of the hold
    released_at?: Date; // Date when the hold was lifted
  };
}
```

#### **Cabinet Model Update**
```typescript
export interface ICabinet extends Document {
  // ... existing fields
  regulatory_hold?: {
    hold_id: mongoose.Types.ObjectId; // Unique identifier for the hold
    reason: string; // Reason for the hold (e.g., legal investigation, audit)
    applied_by: mongoose.Types.ObjectId; // User or entity who applied the hold
    applied_at: Date; // Date when the hold was applied
    status: 'ACTIVE' | 'RELEASED'; // Status of the hold
    released_at?: Date; // Date when the hold was lifted
  };
}
```

#### **File Model Update**
```typescript
export interface IFile extends Document {
  // ... existing fields
  regulatory_hold?: {
    hold_id: mongoose.Types.ObjectId; // Unique identifier for the hold
    reason: string; // Reason for the hold (e.g., legal investigation, audit)
    applied_by: mongoose.Types.ObjectId; // User or entity who applied the hold
    applied_at: Date; // Date when the hold was applied
    status: 'ACTIVE' | 'RELEASED'; // Status of the hold
    released_at?: Date; // Date when the hold was lifted
  };
}
```

#### **Workflow**
- **Hold Application**: When a regulatory hold is applied, this information should be recorded in the `regulatory_hold` field. All attempts to modify or delete the item should be blocked while the hold is active.
- **Hold Release**: Once the regulatory issue is resolved, the hold can be released. The `status` should be updated to `RELEASED`, and the `released_at` date should be recorded.

### 2. **Workflow Triggers and Event Management**

#### **Purpose**
Workflows are critical in automating processes and ensuring consistent handling of events such as document creation, deletion, approval, and more. By capturing the events that trigger specific workflows, the system can automate tasks like notifications, reviews, audits, and regulatory compliance checks.

#### **Implementation in Data Models**
We should introduce a `workflow_triggers` field in the DataRoom, Cabinet, and File models to define which events trigger which workflows. This field should include the type of event, the associated workflow, and any conditions that must be met.

#### **DataRoom Model Update**
```typescript
export interface IDataRoom extends Document {
  // ... existing fields
  workflow_triggers?: {
    event: string; // Type of event (e.g., "CREATED", "DELETED", "MODIFIED")
    workflow_id: mongoose.Types.ObjectId; // ID of the workflow to be triggered
    conditions?: string[]; // Conditions under which the workflow should be triggered
  }[];
}
```

#### **Cabinet Model Update**
```typescript
export interface ICabinet extends Document {
  // ... existing fields
  workflow_triggers?: {
    event: string; // Type of event (e.g., "CREATED", "DELETED", "MODIFIED")
    workflow_id: mongoose.Types.ObjectId; // ID of the workflow to be triggered
    conditions?: string[]; // Conditions under which the workflow should be triggered
  }[];
}
```

#### **File Model Update**
```typescript
export interface IFile extends Document {
  // ... existing fields
  workflow_triggers?: {
    event: string; // Type of event (e.g., "CREATED", "DELETED", "MODIFIED")
    workflow_id: mongoose.Types.ObjectId; // ID of the workflow to be triggered
    conditions?: string[]; // Conditions under which the workflow should be triggered
  }[];
}
```

#### **Workflow**
- **Event Capture**: When an event (e.g., file creation, document deletion) occurs, the system should check the `workflow_triggers` field to see if any workflows are associated with that event.
- **Condition Evaluation**: If conditions are specified, the system should evaluate whether they are met before triggering the workflow.
- **Workflow Execution**: If the event and conditions match, the corresponding workflow should be executed. This could include tasks like sending notifications, updating audit logs, triggering additional approvals, or initiating compliance checks.

### **3. Additional Considerations**

#### **Audit Logging**
- **Integration with Workflow and Hold Management**: Every time a regulatory hold is applied or released, or a workflow is triggered, this should be recorded in the audit trail. This ensures that every action taken in the system is traceable and can be reviewed for compliance.

#### **Configuration and Management**
- **Admin Interfaces**: Provide admin interfaces to configure which events trigger specific workflows. Admins should be able to add, modify, or remove triggers based on the needs of the organization.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring tools to track the execution of workflows and the status of regulatory holds. Alerts should be configured to notify administrators if a workflow fails or if a hold is nearing its expiration date without being resolved.

### **Conclusion**

By integrating regulatory holds and workflow triggers into the DataRoom, Cabinet, and File models, the system becomes more robust and capable of handling complex regulatory and operational requirements. Regulatory holds ensure that sensitive data is preserved during critical periods, while workflow triggers automate key processes, ensuring consistency, compliance, and efficiency. These enhancements not only strengthen data governance but also provide a clear audit trail that supports regulatory compliance and operational transparency.
